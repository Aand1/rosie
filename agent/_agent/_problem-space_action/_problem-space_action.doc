###### State Representation #####

### elaborate-action-operator
	Either copied from superstate.operator,
	Or in evaluate-operator, deep copied from superstate.superstate
	
	
### elaborate generalize-argument
	Goes from a specific instance of an argument to a generalized representation,

### elaborate-goal-satisfaction
	If there is a desired structure, elaborates each predicate with ^satisfied true if satisfied,
		and elaborates ^desired.satisfied true if all predicates in it are satisfied
		
### until-clause
	If there is an until-clause on the state, for each of its predicates elaborate ^satisfied true
		And similarly if all predicates on the until-clause are satisfied, elaborate ^satisfied true
	
### propose-action-operators
If the flag ^problem-space.action.propose-action-operators true is there,
	All primitive actions will be proposed	
	
	
	
### propose-primitive-actions
	Contains proposal rules for primitive actions, proposed in the action problem-space
		if the ^problem-space.action.propose-action-operators true flag is present

### primitive-action-models
	Contains application rules for primitive actions
		done in with ^problem-space.action.type simulate



###### problem-space #####

^problem-space
	^name action
	^action
		^type << simulate execute >>
		^propose-action-operator true

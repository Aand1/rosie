################## action operator-tie #####################

1. During a composite actions, there is no action selection knowledge
   All possible actions are proposed and tie
   This starts a selection space where search is done to try and reach the goal

2. When trying to match a primitive action, multiple operators tie
   We have 3 error handling functions here (report-failure)

   report-failure-missing-argument - a required argument on the action-operator is missing
   report-failure-multiple-arguments - there are multiple arguments of the same name
   report-failure-unmatched-action - a catch all case if the previous 2 aren't called, will abort the action

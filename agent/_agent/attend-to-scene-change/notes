if new(a_p)
	record appearance time

Ignore Anchor
	new anchor doesn't exist for 2 seconds

Add Anchor
	New anchor that has existed for > 2 seconds and does not match a stale anchor
		And is not conatined by an existing object

Remove Anchor
	stale anchor is not occluded, and 

Merged Anchors
	stale anchor is contained by another anchor
	grown anchor contains stale anchor

Fragmenetd Anchor
	several new anchors are contained by the stale one
	a shrunken object conatins a new fragment(s)
	new object is contained by an existing one

Mismatched Anchor
	new anchor is contained by the stale one (single)

Update Object
	grown anchor does not contain any stale objects
	object has moved and is not occluded
	shrunk object is not occluded
	predicate information is different and not occluded


Create Anchor:
	k

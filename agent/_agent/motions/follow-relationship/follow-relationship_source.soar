# Follow-relationship means that you provide a preposition
# and an objection, and the arm positions itself <preposition>
# relative to <object> and follows the object around if it
# moves, trying to keep the same relationship to the object.
#
# It can be called as follows:
# sp {propose*follow-relationship
#   (state <s> .... )
#-->
#   (<s> ^operator <o> +)
#   (<o> ^name follow-relationship
#        ^reference-object <some-obj>
#        ^preposition |preposition name|)
#}
#
# It will look up the preposition by name from smem, project it,
# and move the hand to the projection.

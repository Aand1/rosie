# project-hand operator application source
#
# Computes the (x, y, z) of the hand if it is <some preposition>
# relative to <some object>.
#
# How to call project-hand:
#sp {propose*project-hand
#   (state <s> ... )
#-->
#   (<s> ^operator <o> + =)
#   (<o> ^name project-hand
#        # Give it an object that will be the reference	
#        ^object <obj>
#        # Also give it a preposition
#    	^preposition <prep>
#        # In seconds, how long the projection is expected to be accurate
#        # Make this optional?
#        ^expire-time 1)
#}
#
# Note that this is basically a reimplementation of find-projection where
# one of the objects is the hand instead of a block. I take no credit for
# the details; I just converted it from two block objects to this specialized
# case for ease of use.

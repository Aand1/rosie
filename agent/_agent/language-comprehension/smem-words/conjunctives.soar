# Conjunctions: for, and, but, or, nor, because, while, if, whenever, so, and yet
#1. Coordinating conjunctions join things that are the same, and there are only seven of these. (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so)
#2. Correlative conjunctions are always used in pairs. (either...or, both...and)
#3. Subordinating conjunctions join dependent clauses with independent clauses. There are many subordinating conjunctions. (because, while, whenever, since, if...)

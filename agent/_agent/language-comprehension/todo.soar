###    Need to change that in right-left.soar

################################################################################

#### Soar stuff
### 1. Changes because of ^depth in smem retrieval
### 2. Get chunking working correctly (again)
### 3. Get terminate-sentence working with chunking
### 4. Spreading activation experimentation
####
#### Rosie Structural Stuff
### 2. Make comprehend-word one operator.
### 3. Exclusive should also be able to be required
### 4. Conjunctions for VP and VP - need VP to promote to CP
### 5. Learn new comprehend-word operators so can learn control knowledge to select between them (including RL).
### 6. For constraints such as movable - need more consistent representation and need to be able to have objects
###      objects inherit such features - such as from a category (block1). For now, comment on these constraints.
### 7. When adding new objects to dialog-world.objects, should also be adding relations that 
###    are mentioned in the sentence. Can't wait for downstream processing because can be referred to
###    in follow on clause of same sentence. Maybe need to send semantics downstream immediately as
###    opposed to waiting for end of sentence?  "Store a red block that is behind the green block."  
###    "The goal is that a red block is on a green block" "The goal is that a red block on a green block is under the white block."
### 8. Take advantage of termination for ambiguity in merging - if have hit "." merge with required.
### 9. More robust to all of the failures - still produce semantics if fail. 
###
#### Linguistic stuff
### 1. mission determiners -- next to [ ] enemy locations - usually plurals 
### 2. "that location" should work (instead of it thinking it is getting a relative clause).
### 3.  there are more [Xs] than [Ys]
### 4. X and Y flank Z [inverse of between] 
### 5. Get skipped sentences working (Turn the stove on. The stove is on. The stove is turned on.)
### 6. Construction that starts with an adverb: "Carefully pick up ..."
### 7. Handle both uses of left and right
### 8. more uses of conjunction  move x and y 
### 9. has the same rank as. Has a higher rank than; has more X than Y's

### Change Log
### 8/23/2015
# 1. Replaced ground-referent/failed-grounding.soar: ground-referent*apply*failed-grounding*indefinite*non-location ...*location with 
#    ground-referent*apply*failed-grounding*indefinite*non-category ...*category. These now test that the entity has property.handle 
#    to determine if should create a new object. Should not impact any existing sentences. Should make generalization to 
#    other categories easier (pieces...)  Might interfere with ground-referent*apply*failed-grounding*location
# 2. Modified ground-referent/index-scene-objects.soar: ground-referent*apply*index-scene-objects*create*candidates*dialog*it
#    ground-referent*apply*index-scene-objects*create*candidates*dialog*it*arg1
#    ground-referent*apply*index-scene-objects*create*candidates*dialog*it*next. Will 
#    now use referent in ^arg1 if exists at "it". Otherwise will look for one
#    that has property.handle category (supposed to be more general).
# 3. Added piece/pieces/card/cards to properties.soar and nouns.soar
#
# 8/24/2015
# 4. Add ground-referent/process-plural. This handles the case where a plural was used (all the red blocks) but there is a single 
#    grounded referent. In that case, it throws away that as a possible grounding, which causes a non visual object to be created
#    with property ^multiple true on it.
# 5. Changed goal1 to goal 
# 6. Add |quant-your| to smem - this handles "... all your pieces ..."
# 7. Added "matched" to smem/adjectives
# 8. Added |but| to conjunctives.soar - same as |and| needs some modifier...
# 9. Added adjacent and equal diagonal to relations.soar and prepositions.soar
#10. Modified verbs.soar so stack works with multiple objects using and
#
# 8/25/2015
# 1. created mobile-task-instructions-v2.soar - most of today's changes are to make those sentences work.
# 2. add "remember .. as ..." to verbs; "recall DP"; "stapler" as noun; visible as adjective; message as noun; Bob; heard; said; response; question;  current; soar (adj) main (adj).
# 3. remove ground-referent*apply*index-scene-objects*create*current-location*object and add ^property current for the current location and ^property starting for the starting location.
# 4. modify comprehension*propose*process-missing-assigner*before*x so it doesn't apply if the 
#    assigner that is being removed has a potential receiver with the structure as a subpart.
# 5. Add remember-if because too hard to get working as combination of existing construction
# 6. modify comprehension*elaborate*possible-merge so it won't apply if there is another require
#    assigner that must come before the assigner being considered for the merge.
#
# 8/27/2015
# 1. Modify ground-referent*apply*failed-grounding*property16 so it doesn't copy handle so often. REquires updating expectations. 
# 2. Change how "it" is used - cover missing cases.

#
# 9/1/2015
# 1. Added rules to copy constraints in ground-referent from the ^parameter to constraint - had some constraints (especially relations in "to the right of" lost.
# 2. Modify merge to reject merge with right/left-noun that don't make sense

# 9/2/2015
# 1. For new games added lots of new nouns, verbs, prepositions (between) - need to do more on between.
# 2. Add special flag ^strip-assigners true for "named" so that what follows it is just picked up without it having to fill any assigners.
# 3. added apply*merge*constraint*preposition-noun-special to handle special case of named preposition - this is surely a hack.
# 4. Add ^hypothetical true to parent receiver - when encounter, add ^hypothetical true to segment. Change to if.soar and comprehend-word. 
# 5. If ^hypothetical true, on multiple grounding, assume need a description, not a grounding. Modify process-multiple-grounding.soar to mark prototype-referents none. [restricted to only multiples on 9/4]
# 6. Disabled *-DP-V as it was causing problems.

# 9/3/2015 
# 1. Modified If construction so it is C and then converts to CP - otherwise it merges too early
# 2. Modify selection rules in comprehend-construction to subtly change when it is selected relative to merge.
# 3. Eliminate "," as option in IF - so Then can be required.

# 9/4/2015 
# 1. Constrained comprehension*propose*process-missing-assigner*new so doesn't knock out possible future matches.
# 2. Modify change from 9/2: 5 - need to restrict to only when expecting multiples. If definitive - try to pick one.
# 3. Add propose*process-semantics*DP-with-of-DP*referent so it picks up a referent if one exists for a relation

# 9/6/2015
# 1. Remove referent literal from there-is constructions. Not sure why it was there (sic).

#9/8/2015
# 1. Modify merge-apply.soar and process-semantics and process-semantics.soar to support ternary relations (between)
# 2. Removed place as a noun and made it a verb

###    Need to change that in this.soar and relative-pronoun.soar - and right-left.soar

### Add item-type
#### - Use constraint from verb for selecting "it"

###                    ^semantic-entity-type relation
###                    ^semantic-structure predicate

### +1. Conjunctions for VP and VP - need VP to promote to CP
###  8. Look at reconfiguring some of the constructions - especially the is ones. 
### Change "is" constructions so DP-ISV is recognized and then DP-ISV - X - 
### so the X's are separate construction instead of having one big DP-ISV construction...

### -3. Changes because of ^depth in smem retrieval
### -6. Make comprehend-word one operator.
### -1. Get chunking working correctly (again)
### -2. Get terminate-sentence working with chunking
### -3. Get skipped sentences working (Turn the stove on. The stove is on. The stove is turned on.)
### -2. right of and left of
### -4. Construction that starts with an adverb: "Carefully pick up ..."
###  7. Spreading activation experimentation
###  9. Learn new comprehend-word operators so can learn control knowledge to select
###     between them (including RL).
###  10. "onto"/"into" cannot be a preposition associated with a DP - must be with a VP (same with "to" except for "to the left of"
###  11. For constraints such as movable - need more consistent representation and need to be able to have objects
###      objects inherit such features - such as from a category (block1). For now, comment on these constraints.

# 1. When adding new objects to dialog-world.objects, should also be adding relations that 
#    are mentioned in the sentence. Can't wait for downstream processing because can be referred to
#    in follow on clause of same sentence. Maybe need to send semantics downstream immediately as
#    opposed to waiting for end of sentence?  "Store a red block that is behind the green block."  
#    "The goal is that a red block is on a green block" "The goal is that a red block on a green block is under the white block."

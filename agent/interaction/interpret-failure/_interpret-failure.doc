interpret-failure

This operator is proposed when a failure is reported to interaction.status
In the substate, the failure is taken care of and proper steps are taken.
For each failure type, there should be a interpret-FAILURE-TYPE operator to handle it
This operator should mark what needs to change on the state, and the complete-interpret-failure operator
  will apply those changes (see change-list below)

##### Superoperator Rep #####

^failure <f> # from interaction.status.failure <f>

###### change-list #####

These are things you can add to the state which will be applied
  during complete-interpret-failure
  
^new-segment-info <info> # info for a new segment to be added (see push-segment)
^outgoing-message <msg>  # A message to be sent to the instructor, handled by interpret-message
^terminate-segment true  # Pop the current interaction segment
^remove-message true     # If there is a new-message on interaction.status, remove it
^pop-action true         # Pop the current action from the action-stack
